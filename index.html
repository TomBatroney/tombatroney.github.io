							<p align="left" style="color:rgb(138, 138, 138);font-size:18px;">Some of my fondest childhood memories growing up in Northeastern Pennsylvania were in the woods and next to water. Summer camping trips, building dirt bike ramps out of scrap plywood in the woods, swimming, cliff jumping and fishing in the nearby cricks. When it came time to go to college and pick a major I knew what I wanted to do, preferably something outdoors helping the land and water.</p>

							<p align="left" style="color:rgb(138, 138, 138);font-size:18px;">After high school I would enroll in the Environmental Engineering program at nearby Wilkes University and would learn about ways to engineer our water, land, and air. But water always interested me the most. The physics and movement of water, the chemical reactions that go into treating water, and using computer modeling software and GIS mapping to solve problems. Going into my senior year my advisor would encourage me to apply to graduate schools. Luckily I landed a internship and scholarship at Villanova University where I studied at the Villanova Urban Stormwater Partnership as full time graduate student. There I further grew my water resources engineering knowledge in stormwater management, low impact development/green stormwater infrastructure, performance monitoring equipment/data analysis, hydrologic and hydraulic modeling theory, and writing/defending a Master's thesis on my research.</p>
								
							<p align="left" style="color:rgb(138, 138, 138);font-size:18px;">Now I'm living and working in Pittsburgh on water resources projects and adding to that base knowledge. I'm really still the kid who loves being outdoors, is curious about water, and learning as much as I can about it. Although I don't get to fish or build dirt bike jumps nearly as much as I would like.</p>

							<h1 align="left">Pittsburgh Office Lead, AKRF (03/2020 to 04/2022)</h1>
							<p align="left" style="color:rgb(138, 138, 138);font-size:18px;">Led AKRF's Pittsburgh office water resources operations and Midwest water business development initiatives. 
								My role was to promote AKRF's 
								technical expertise in stormwater management and business in the
								Midwest with strategic pursuits primarily for public sector water clients. 
								Also provided remote based technical oversight and 
								guidance to junior and mid-level staff stationed in the Philadelphia office.</p> 

							<h1 align="left">Senior Principal Engineer, Mott MacDonald (2007 to 03/2020)</h1>
							<p align="left" style="color:rgb(138, 138, 138);font-size:18px;">Hired out of college as entry level engineer for Mott MacDonald where I would eventually become 
								promoted into a senior principal engineer. 
								As an early career professional I cut my teeth with field work including 
								stream monitoring and construction inspection oversight.
								I would then transition to design of sewer collection systems, 
								combined sewer structures, and waste water pumping stations. 
								From there I would transition into combined sewer overflow 
								and sanitary sewer overflow consent order planning work 
								for several mid size and major cities in the Midwest and Northeast portions of the country.
